[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/agrover/af_unix-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/agrover/af_unix-rs)

Use AF_UNIX sockets from rust. Not sure why this isn't supported natively..
hopefully it will be added soon.

Code based on https://github.com/Geal/rust-syslog, which did most of this
but didn't have it broken out separately.
